# Contributing

Meerschaum is free and open source software, built to make data engineering more accessible.
You can help steer the development of Meerschaum in several ways:

1. **Report bugs on the [issues tracker](https://github.com/bmeares/Meerschaum/issues).**

  No matter how large or small, your input is greatly appreciated and gives me a better understanding of the needs of real users.

2. **Join the [discussions board](https://github.com/bmeares/Meerschaum/discussions).**

  Feature requests, suggestions, and even showcases are welcome!

3. **[Write and publish plugins](https://meerschaum.io/reference/plugins/writing-plugins/).**

  If you publish a plugin to the public [`api:mrsm` repository](https://api.mrsm.io/dash/) and post in the [plugins showcase discussion](https://github.com/bmeares/Meerschaum/discussions/50), I will review and possibly include it on the [List of Plugins reference page](https://meerschaum.io/reference/plugins/list-of-plugins/).

## What About Pull Requests?

If you write code directly and open a PR, I will consider your changes, but due to the development pattern of Meerschaum, I likely may choose to reject PRs for a number of reasons. A more effective method of addressing your concerns is to open an issue or start a discussion.

## Sponsorship

Consider [sponsoring Meerschaum](https://github.com/sponsors/bmeares) as a way to prioritize your issues or feature requests. Your support is always greatly appreciated!
