# Plugins

Meerschaum gives you the ability to easily install and create plugins. Reference the guide below on how to install, write, and publish plugins.

## Types of Plugins

Meerschaum plugins can perform any of three functions:

1. Fetch
2. Sync
3. Action

### Fetch Plugins

Fetch plugins are the most straightforward: they pull data from some data source and return a dictionary or Pandas DataFrame. For example, one common use-case for a fetch plugin is to parse JSON data from a web API.
