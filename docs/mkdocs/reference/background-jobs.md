# ðŸ‘· Background Jobs

Some actions need to run continuously, such as running the API or syncing pipes in a loop. Rather than relying on `systemd` or `cron`, you can use the built-in jobs system.

All Meerschaum actions may be executed as background jobs by adding `-d` or `--daemon` flags or by prefacing the command with `start job`. A specific label may be assigned to a job with `--name`.

You can monitor the status of jobs with `show logs`, which will follow the logs of running jobs.
