## New Video Series and Now Available for Consulting!
> *28 January 2022*

Hello, World! There's a lot to cover, so I'll cut straight to the point: I've just started a new video series [*Learning Meerschaum*](/tutorials), the show where I give viewers ways Meerschaum can make their lives as data analysts easier. [In the first episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS9ZAG4INPk) (embedded below), I walk through building a SQL pipe from the remote database [Splitgraph](https://www.splitgraph.com/connect). We also take a quick look at Grafana and how easy it is to use the integrated Grafana service.

I'm also ready to make the announcement: I am now officially open for consulting projects! Yes, you read that right â€• you can hire me, the author of Meerschaum, to help you build your data streams! My rates are flexible, so if you're interested in recruiting my help, head over to my [GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/bmeares) and let's get started!
