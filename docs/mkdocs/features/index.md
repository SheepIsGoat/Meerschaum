# Feature Showcase

The goal behind Meerschaum is to be *The Data Engineer's Toolbox*: to offer features that help you:

- Create and manage your datastreams
- Quickly build a scalable, customizable backend
- Connect unrelated systems for analysis
- Integrate new systems with your existing infrastructure

No matter your situation, Meerschaum can drastically reduce your development time. Continue reading below to see how Meerschaum can help you take your backend to another level.

## Pipes

With Meerschaum, your datastreams are called [pipes](/reference/pipes/). Pipes are organized into a hierarchy so that you can manage select datastreams at once.

## Bootstrapping
The [bootstrap command](/get-started/bootstrapping-a-pipe/) walks you through the steps for creating a new pipe and makes adding datastreams straightforward.
