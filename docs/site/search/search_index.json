Read the Quick Start guide below and follow the steps to install and use Meerschaum. Quick Start Requirements To install Meerschaum, you need will need Python 3.7+ with pip installed. (Optional but recommended) Server Stack Requirements Meerschaum comes with the stack command which leverages Docker Compose to create all the necessary services in a full-stack Meerschaum installation \u2015 services such as a database instance, API server, pre-configured Grafana instance, MQTT broker, and more. The stack is only needed for back-end server installations and is optional, so you can skip this step for any of the following reasons: You want a minimal install with SQLite instead of a dedicated database like TimescaleDB. You don't want to / can't install Docker. You can install and run Meerschaum without any elevated privileges. More info on running unprivileged Meerschaum here . You only need to use Meerschaum as a client for an existing Meerschaum instance. If you plan on running the default, pre-configured Meerschaum database, make sure you have Docker installed. Docker is used for the stack command, so if you have another database, you can skip installing Docker. If you are running Linux, search your repositories for docker.io or run this script: curl https://get.docker.com | sh If you're on Windows or MacOS, install Docker Desktop . Installation Install Meerschaum from PyPI : python -m pip install --upgrade meerschaum Meerschaum will auto-install packages in as you use them (into a virtual environment, to preserve your base environment). If you'd rather install all of its dependencies at installation, you can request the full version: python -m pip install --upgrade meerschaum[full] That's it! You've got Meerschaum installed. Continue below for information on bringing up a stack and creating your first pipes. Starting the Stack To bring up the stack, run the following command: mrsm stack up [-d] The stack command is an alias for docker-compose , and any flags passed to docker-compose are wrapped in brackets (e.g. [-d] ).

Expect to encounter bugs, and please open issues when you find them! Meerschaum is distributed with no warranty, so use with care! Meerschaum was built using powerful open source software like TimescaleDB, Grafana, pandas, and more. Check the Thank You section below for more information about dependencies. Setup Requirements To install Meerschaum, you need will pip installed. To access the full feature set of Meerschaum, make sure you have Docker installed. If you are running Linux, search your repositories for docker.io or run this script: curl https://get.docker.com | sh If you're on Windows or MacOS, install Docker Desktop . Installation To install the full version of Meerschaum, install with pip : pip install meerschaum[full] Quickstart Launch the Meerschaum Shell To jump into the mrsm shell, run the command: mrsm All standard actions can either be executed from within the mrsm shell or on the command line directly. For example, the command $ mrsm show version is equivalent to $ mrsm > show version Start the Stack To start the Meerschaum stack in the background (using docker-compose -d ), run the command mrsm stack [-d] Add a Connector If you want to create a Pipe for remote data, you first need to define a Connector. Run this command to open the configuration YAML file with your text editor: mrsm edit config For this example, let's add a connector called exampledb . Add a new entry under the sql section: meerschaum: connectors: sql: exampledb: username: myuser password: mypass flavor: postgresql host: myserverhostname database: mydb Note that for sqlite connectors, only the database parameter is needed (path to the .sqlite file). Register a Pipe Pipes are defined by three keys: 1. Connection (keys for a connector in the format type:label ; e.g. sql:exampledb for the Connector added above) 2. Metric (label for the contents of the Pipe's data, such as power or temperature ) 3. Location (optional; None if omitted) To register a Pipe, run this command: mrsm register pipes -c sql:exampledb -m mydata This will create a Pipe with the connector we added above ( sql:exampledb ) and the metric mydata . The location for this Pipe is None . Next, we need to edit the parameters for this pipe. Run this command to open your text editor: mrsm edit pipes -c sql:exampledb -m mydata For this example, edit the YAML file to look something like this: columns: datetime: mydtcolumn id: myidcolumn fetch: definition: SELECT * FROM mytable This information describes the remote dataset we will add into the Pipe. The columns defined will be indexed, and the definition is executed on the remote server to get the data. Add Data to a Pipe If you defined the parameters described above, just run the command below to fetch new data and sync the Pipe: mrsm sync pipes If you want to add an existing dataframe to a Pipe, run pipe.sync(df) to append the dataframe to the Pipe's table. You can launch into a Python shell with mrsm python : >>> import meerschaum as mrsm >>> pipe = mrsm.Pipe('sql:exampledb', 'mydata') >>> >>> ### if pipe has not been registered, you can define columns here >>> if not pipe.columns: >>> pipe.columns = { 'datetime' : 'mydtcolumn', 'id' : 'myidcolumn' } >>> >>> import pandas as pd >>> df = pd.read_csv('mydata.csv') >>> >>> pipe.sync(df) In this case, the Pipe has created and indexed the table sql_exampledb_mydata on the Meerschaum TimescaleDB database. Create Visualizations with Grafana Grafana is included in the Meerschaum stack, pre-configured with the Meerschaum TimescaleDB database. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 and log in to Grafana with username admin , password admin . FAQ What are Pipes, exactly? Pipes are built from TimescaleDB Hypertables , which are PostgreSQL tables with special datetime indexing and functions. In future releases of Meerschaum, Pipes may be created from continous aggregate views . I broke my configuration. How do I start over? The command to reset your configuration files is: bootstrap config If that doesn't work, just remove the folder ~/.config/meerschaum ( %AppData%/Meerschaum on Windows). To completely remove the stack and its data, run this command: stack down [-v] which is equivalent to docker-compose down -v . I can't open the Meerschaum shell! You can invoke mrsm directly with python -m meerschaum . Check that your PATH includes packages installed by pip , such as ~/.local/bin . How do I turn off the emoji / colors / I'm running Windows? Open the configuration file with mrsm edit config and search for the key formatting under the system section. From there, you can turn off emoji ( unicode: false ) or colors ( ansi: false ). Connectors don't work for <database flavor> ! Although Connectors should work with any database flavor supported by sqlalchemy Engines, it is difficult to test against many database flavors. When bugs are encountered, please open an issue and describe your configuration! As of now, there is (limited) support for the following database flavors: - PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB - MySQL / MariaDB - MSSQL - Oracle SQL (limited support, testing needed) - SQLite Thank you I want to give my sincere thanks to the developers of the following projects: - Docker - Pandas - SQLAlchemy - FastAPI - Uvicorn - pprintpp - CascaDict - pyvim - Colorama - more_termcolor - SQL CLI Tools - rich -","title":"old README"},{"location":"old_README/#build-pipes-with-meerschaum","text":"Meerschaum is a platform for quickly creating and managing time-series data streams called Pipes.
